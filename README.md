# 👋 Hi, I'm Jina Park!

🎭 Architectural Engineering • Ballet • Acting • Coding  
💡 Designing emotion-aware AI through the fusion of art and technology

---

I hold academic degrees in **architectural engineering, ballet, and acting**.  
This unique combination of structural thinking, artistic intuition, and embodied expression  
deeply informs the way I design **emotion-aware interactive systems** today.

My goal is to create technology that not only functions,  
but **feels** — that senses, responds, and resonates with human emotion.  
I believe **technology should not just be intelligent, but also empathetic**.  
That's the direction I'm headed.
